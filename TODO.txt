- epsilon for face/edge intersections near grid points (depends on resolution?)
- patches between meshes (with optional geometry shader stage?)
- offset for meshes/generator
- GL_ARB_sparse_texture?
- trade-off triangle-fold-overs vs. clean edges 
- performance optimizations (calculation threads, one render thread)
